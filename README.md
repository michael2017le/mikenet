# mikenet
Built from scratch deep learning library!

## Use it yourself!
You only need to install NumPy to use it but just in case run this and you're all set!

**Python3:**
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Python2 for some reason:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run Examples:
Once your dependencies are in, you can run these files like any other Python files!

**Linear Regression:**
```
python3.6 linear_regression.py
```
**Sine:**
```
python3.6 sine.py
```

**Xor**
```
python3.6 xor.py
```

Or whatever version of Python you're using!

## TODO:
- MORE LAYERS: RNN, LSTM, 
- MORE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS: sigmoid/softmax,
- MORE LOSS FUNCTIONS: cross-entropy, log-likelihood
- MORE OPTIMIZERS: Adam, RMSProp
